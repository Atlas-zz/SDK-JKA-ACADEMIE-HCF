Ok, this version will work with vc7.net, vc6 and will also build on linux (type make in the game dir to create the .so file).

Credits go to the linux patch creator (don't know his/her name, website is: http://divoid.net/) and to Legacy for providing the vc6 dsp/dsw files.  All I did was run the patch, tar it and upload it.  

Note that this is the *vanilla* source (ie, other than the linux fixes, this code contains *NO* alterations, mods, bug fixes, etc).
